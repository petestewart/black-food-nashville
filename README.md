# Black Food Nashville

This is a single-page web application I created for users to be able to both discover and support Black-owned restaurants in the Nashville area. I built this app with React and utilized REST API's from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/fusion), [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It was my front-end capstone project while enrolled at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/).

After seeing a number of posts on social media with lists of local Black-owned restaurants for people to support, often in the form of screenshots or simple lists, I decided to create this application as a more convenient way for people to find, share and support these businesses. 

### Feature List
* Automatically utilizes user's current geolocation on initial load
* User can search by specific location and radius
* Search results can be filtered by cuisine, delivery service and hours open
* Buttons to share a restaurant to Facebook, Twitter or by email
* Order menu for each restaurant with direct links to delivery services and restaurant's phone number
* Direct links to restaurant's website and Yelp page
* Optional user login/registration with Google
* Registered user can save restaurants to favorites list
* Registered user can submit new restaurants or changes to existing restaurants
* Integrated Yelp search when submitting a new restaurant to import existing business data
* User authorized as an administrator can approve or deny user submissions
